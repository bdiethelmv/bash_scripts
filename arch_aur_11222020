To browse for packages, go to aur.archlinux.org and type a search query
in "Package Search"

When a package is found, click download snapshot and save the tarball
Usually the following works:
tar -xvf <filename>

Change directory to the extracted folder

The PKGBUILD is the file that builds the program. It is a good idea to
read what it actually does before proceeding with the command below

makepkg -s

When done, install the generated package
sudo pacman -U <tarball name>
